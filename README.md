## Tutorial Title
Applied Deep Learning for NLP Applications

## Abstract
Natural language processing (NLP) has become an important field with interest from many important sectors that leverage modern deep learning methods for approaching several NLP problems and tasks such as text summarization, question answering, and sentiment classification, to name a few. In this tutorial, we will introduce several of the fundamental NLP techniques and more modern approaches (BERT, GTP-2, etc.) and show how they can be applied to approach many real-world NLP problems. We will focus on how to build an NLP pipeline using several open-source tools. Then we will learn how to use the model built to leverage it for real-world applications like searching over documents based on semantic relationships. In essence, the learner will take away the important theoretical pieces needed to build practical NLP pipelines to address a wider variety of problems. 

## Audience
The target audience for this tutorial are ideally participants with some exposure to the Python programming language and have used natural language processing language tools such as spaCy or NLTK. Knowledge of machine learning tools is also a benefit as we will be using them in this tutorial. Beginners are also welcome but still require at least some theoretical understanding of NLP and machine learning concepts.

## Outline (for 3.5 hours)

### Module 1 - Introduction to NLP Fundamentals
In this module we will brielfy introduce the fundamental NLP concepts that are necessary to begin building more sophisticated NLP pipelines. For instance, how o

### Module 2 - 

### Module 3 - Building Real-World NLP Applications
In this module we are going to focus on putting everything that was learned in the previous modules and build and test a proof of concept NLP application using purely open source technologies. 


a series of important open source tools.
